<p style="color: darkred;">"In my Father's house there are many dwelling places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be." John 14: 2-3</p>

<h1>Welcome to The Father's House.</h1>
</div>
  <p>We are a new Lay Apostolate in the Diocese of Amarillo. We are faithful to Holy Mother Church and are dedicated to showing the love and mercy of our Blessed Lord. We minister to our brothers and sisters who struggle with addiction, homelessness, hunger, and many other afflictions. We, at The Father's House, strive to offer the peace of Christ to all who come. We are not here to judge you in your struggles or shame you. We offer you the same love that our Blessed Lord offers us. We want to show that we love you and don't want you to stay trapped by your afflictions. We will walk with you, pray with you, laugh with you, and cry with you. We are here for you.  </p>
  
  <p>We hope that you will be filled with the peace of Christ, when you visit our website or walk through our doors. Please join us for daily Mass, Eucharistic Adoration, Scripture studies, and recitiation of the Holy Rosary. We invite you to view our Ministries and Contact pages to learn more about us. May God bless you! Please pray for us and be assured of our prayers for you.</p>
