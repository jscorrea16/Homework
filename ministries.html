<h1>Ministries:</h1>
  
<p><b>The least of these:</b> We serve the least of these by providing for the spiritual, physical, and mental well-being of those in our care. Prayer is the center of everything we do. We encourage all, regardless of their faith tradition, to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, Eucharistic Adoration, or Scripture studies. We also have large food serving facilities and we provide housing and clothes. A Christian Counselor is available to our brothers and sisters.</p>

<p><b>For those who are burdened by various addictions:</b> We begin helping those burdened by addiction first and foremost by prayer. Our counselor develops individual or group therapy sessions based on each person's needs. Sr. Maria is available througout the day to provide counseling and organinze therapy sessions. Father Joseph is available for confession and Pastoral counseling throughout the day as well. If you just need someone to talk to, Joshua and any of our volunteers would love to help. We accompany our brothers and sisters every step toward the freedom only our Blessed Lord can offer them.</p>
